# Search-Engine-Using-NLP-and-TF-IDF

Zoogle is a mini search engine project built as part of the DSAI 201 course. It demonstrates how natural language processing techniques like TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and vectorization can be used to create a functional search engine from scratch.

## 🚀 Features

- Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization
- Cosine similarity ranking for relevance
- Query preprocessing with stopword removal
- Ranking of documents based on query relevance
- GUI interface using Streamlit (if applicable)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Streamlit (optional for UI)
